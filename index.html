                I received a job offer mid-course, and the sbjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                " I was an EMT for many years before I joined bootcamp. I've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for free course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                Since completeing the course, I've successfully switched
                careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                " Before joining the bootcam, I've never written a line of code.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can helo me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assitance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full stack web developer
                after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
